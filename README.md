## About

Completing the pen plotting trilogy of "⚖️ Concord", and "a strange and desolate place", we have moved from the shelter to the land and now into space. The Presence will be our guide, having drained the land of colour, its hunger seeks distant planets.

This was an airdrop for owners of "a strange and desolate place" (#10817), a snapshot of which was taken at 8:23pm on a dark Friday evening, 25th November 2022 in the UK.
